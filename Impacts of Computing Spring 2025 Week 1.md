The goal of this week is to dive right into the key concepts of the course by engaging with some readings and viewings, and interacting with our classmates in Mattermost. 

Please start by listening to this brief audio introduction to Week 1.

Here is the work for Week 1:

1. ***A Story to Get Us Started*** - Please listen to this brief story from my long-past teenage years. Please ignore the reference to 2022. I recorded this as part of an earlier section of this course.

2. ***Readings***

Somers, [The Pastry AI that Learned to Fight Cancer](https://manhattanville-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/gerald_ardito_mville_edu/EdqC1Q9XXhJCui3FnNp196wBS8qAl2tdpbgM1NovaZiUcg?e=m8dIk6)

Thompson, [The Miserable Lives of Cyborg Truck Drivers](https://www.joyk.com/dig/detail/1648586901236450#gsc.tab=0) 

Read these two articles about recent examples of how AI and algorithms have been employed in two very different settings: a bakery and with long-distance truckers. As you read these articles, please **keep notes** in your **course notebook**. For each article: 

​	a) take notes on the articles themselves, indicating what you think are the key points of each; 

​	b) note any issues that involve ethics or morality (more about that next week); and 

​	c) take note of what struck you, what surprised you, and what you would want to know more about. 



3. ***Interactions***

   Now that you have done some listening and reading and thinking, it's time to interact with me and your classmates. These interactions will take place in Mattermost. For this week, please do these two things in Mattermost. 
- First, *imagine this scenario*. You are about to get in a store line and are in a hurry because you need to get to a doctor's appointment. You notice that the person ahead of you has a million items and is moving very slowly. What do you do? What ethical criteria do you use to decide how to handle this? Please post this to the ***Week 1*** channel in Mattermost. [Here is a quick guide to joining a channel](https://docs.mattermost.com/collaborate/join-leave-channels.html) in Mattermost. You should post your response **no later than the end of the day on Friday, January 24**.
- Second, *interact with one another*. This course is designed to be discussion intensive, and so I ask that you engage often (post ***at least 3 responses*** to your classmates' posts) and substantively. I expect your responses to ***move the conversation forward*** with your classmates in these Mattermost discussions. I expect you to treat each other with respect and compassion (even when disagreeing), and to write in standard English. 

This work is due by the end of the day on **Monday, January 27th**.
